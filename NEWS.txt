CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.0.9018
-------------------------
NEW FEATURES

    o Additional optional arguments were provided for the DrawModLogo 
	  function, allowing the user to label some positions and to modify the 
	  axis and labels.
	
	o The DrawLogoPosNegAxes function has been added and is mostly adapted
	  from functions from the seqLogo package. This function is directly 
	  used by the updated DrawModLogo function.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Logolas dependency has been replaced by the seqLogo and grid packages.

    o The DrawModLogo function has been reworked using seqLogo and grid: 
	  cLogoType argument has been removed (the cYunit and lPlotNegYAxis 
	  arguments should be used instead), cColorsCTAG argument has been 
	  replaced by the cColorsACGT to be more consistent with the 
	  nGenomicBgACGT argument, and default color values have been modified.
	
	o lFiltParam argument has been removed from the FiltPacBio and 
	  FiltDeepSignal functions: the parameter will be filtered using 
	  intervals as long as nFiltParamLoBoundaries and nFiltParamHiBoundaries
	  arguments are provided.

BUG FIXES

    o Various bug fixes and documentation updates.
