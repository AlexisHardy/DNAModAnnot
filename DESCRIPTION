Description: Use modifications detection output (from 
    kineticsTools and PacBio sequencing data) to filter out 
	potential false positives and analyze the distribution 
	of DNA modifications in the genome assembly provided. 
	Aligned Illumina sequencing data (bam files) can also be
	used for analysis.
